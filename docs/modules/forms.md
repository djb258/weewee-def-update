## Integration Notes

- **Database Integration**: Form field names must match Neon database column names exactly
- **Client Configuration**: Forms load schema from `config/clients.json` based on client_id
- **File Upload**: Supports document uploads with validation and storage in Neon
- **Validation**: Both client-side and server-side validation implemented
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful endpoints for form submission, validation, and schema retrieval
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback system
- **Performance**: Optimized for large form submissions and concurrent users

### Key Components

- `ClientOnboardingForm`: Main form component with dynamic fields
- `FormField`: Reusable form field component with validation
- `FormSection`: Sectioned form layout for better UX
- `FormValidation`: Client-side validation logic
- `FormSubmission`: Loading states and submission handling

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/forms/submit`: Form submission endpoint
- `POST /api/forms/validate`: Server-side validation
- `GET /api/forms/schema/:clientId`: Dynamic form schema
- `POST /api/forms/upload`: File upload handling

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual form components
- Integration tests for form submission flow
- E2E tests for complete form workflow
- Validation tests for all field types
- File upload functionality testing
