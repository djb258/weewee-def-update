### Parent/Child Architecture

- This repository is the **parent/master doctrine repo** for the system.
- All child repositories must derive their structure, rules, and module definitions from this parent.
- Updates flow **parent â†’ child** via controlled tooling or merge processes.
- No child repo may diverge from the doctrine, module structure, or process policy defined here.
- All foundational updates are made here and then propagated to children.
