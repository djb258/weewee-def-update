### Update Flow Stages

#### 1. Development Phase

- **Branch Creation**: Create feature branch from appropriate base branch
- **Module Development**: Develop changes within specific module scope
- **Local Testing**: Unit tests and local integration testing
- **Code Review**: Self-review and documentation updates
- **Branch Push**: Push feature branch to remote repository

#### 2. Integration Phase

- **Pull Request**: Create PR with detailed description and testing notes
- **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline runs comprehensive test suite
- **Code Review**: Peer review of changes and integration considerations
- **Integration Testing**: Test module integration with other components
- **Documentation Update**: Update relevant documentation and README files

#### 3. Testing Phase

- **Staging Deployment**: Deploy to staging environment for testing
