# Merge Strategy Process Documentation

## Purpose

Defines the merge strategy for all modules and processes. Ensures all child repos follow the same merge and integration process.

## Version / Status

- Version: 1.0.0
- Status: Foundation locked

## Related Branches / Tags

- docs/processes/merge-strategy
- v1.0.0-process

## Integration Notes

- All child repos must follow this merge strategy for all integrations.

## Integration Notes

- **Git Workflow**: Feature branch development with pull request reviews
- **Automated Testing**: CI/CD integration for automated testing on merge
- **Code Review**: Mandatory code review before merge approval
- **Conflict Resolution**: Systematic approach to resolving merge conflicts
- **Release Management**: Tagged releases for version control and deployment

### Branch Strategy

#### Main Branch Structure

- **main**: Production-ready code, stable releases
- **develop**: Integration branch for feature development
- **staging**: Pre-production testing and validation
- **feature branches**: Individual feature development

#### Module-Specific Branches

- **feat/forms-build**: Form components and API development
- **feat/neon-tables**: Database schema and migrations
- **feat/landing-pages**: Landing page templates and components
- **feat/vendor-routing**: Email routing and vendor management
- **feat/client-ui**: Dashboard and client interface development

#### Client-Specific Branches

- **client/[client-name]-v[version]**: Client-specific configurations
- **hotfix/[client-name]-[issue]**: Emergency fixes for specific clients

### Merge Process

#### Feature Branch Merges

1. **Development Complete**: Feature development finished and tested
2. **Pull Request Creation**: Create PR with detailed description
3. **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline runs comprehensive tests
4. **Code Review**: Peer review of changes and integration impact
5. **Integration Testing**: Test feature integration with other modules
6. **Documentation Update**: Update relevant documentation
7. **Merge Approval**: Final approval and merge to target branch

#### Module Integration Merges

1. **Module Testing**: Complete module testing and validation
2. **Integration Testing**: Test module integration with other components
3. **Performance Validation**: Performance testing and optimization
4. **Security Review**: Security assessment for module changes
5. **Documentation Review**: Comprehensive documentation updates
6. **Staging Deployment**: Deploy to staging for final validation
7. **Production Merge**: Merge to main for production deployment

#### Client-Specific Merges

1. **Client Configuration**: Client-specific configuration validated
2. **Custom Features**: Client-specific features tested
3. **Integration Testing**: Test with client's specific requirements
4. **Client Approval**: Client approval of changes and features
5. **Deployment Planning**: Plan deployment with minimal disruption
6. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production for client

### Conflict Resolution

#### Merge Conflict Types

- **Code Conflicts**: Direct code conflicts requiring manual resolution
- **Configuration Conflicts**: Client-specific configuration conflicts
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Module dependency version conflicts
- **Documentation Conflicts**: Documentation update conflicts

#### Resolution Process

1. **Conflict Identification**: Identify and document conflict details
2. **Impact Assessment**: Assess impact on other modules and clients
3. **Resolution Planning**: Plan resolution approach and timeline
4. **Manual Resolution**: Resolve conflicts with proper testing
5. **Validation**: Test resolved conflicts thoroughly
6. **Documentation**: Document resolution approach and decisions

### Quality Assurance

#### Pre-Merge Requirements

- **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, and code quality checks
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% test coverage for new features
- **Performance**: Performance benchmarks met
- **Security**: Security review completed
- **Documentation**: Documentation updated and reviewed

#### Post-Merge Validation

- **Integration Testing**: Verify module integration
- **Performance Testing**: Validate performance impact
- **Security Testing**: Confirm security standards maintained
- **Client Impact**: Assess impact on existing clients
- **Rollback Preparation**: Prepare rollback procedures if needed

### Release Management

#### Version Tagging

- **Semantic Versioning**: Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **Release Tags**: Tag releases for version control
- **Changelog**: Maintain detailed changelog for each release
- **Release Notes**: Generate release notes for clients

#### Deployment Coordination

- **Staged Deployment**: Deploy to staging before production
- **Client Communication**: Communicate changes to affected clients
- **Monitoring**: Monitor system health during and after deployment
- **Rollback Plan**: Maintain rollback procedures for failed deployments
