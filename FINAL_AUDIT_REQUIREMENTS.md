## üîç AUDIT EXECUTION COMMANDS

### Run Complete Audit
```bash
# Full doctrine enforcement audit
npx tsx universal_doctrine_enforcer.ts

# ORBT-specific validation
node orbt-validate.js

# UDNS-specific validation  
node udns-validate.js

# Build integration check
npx tsx build_integration.ts

# Diagnostic coverage validation
npx tsx diagnostic_injector.ts --validate
```

### Check Individual Components
```bash

## üìä COMPLIANCE STATUS TRACKING

### Status Flags
- üî¥ **RED**: Critical violations - deployment blocked
- üü° **YELLOW**: Warnings - must be addressed before deployment
- üü¢ **GREEN**: Fully compliant - deployment allowed

### Compliance Report Location
- `doctrine_compliance_report.json` - Generated by universal doctrine enforcer
- `orbt/ORBT_STATUS.json` - Generated by ORBT validator

---

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Deployment Allowed When:
- ‚úÖ All checkboxes above are completed
- ‚úÖ All audit commands return exit code 0
- ‚úÖ Compliance status is GREEN
- ‚úÖ No critical violations in compliance report
- ‚úÖ All warnings addressed or documented

### Final Validation Command:
```bash
# This must return exit code 0 for deployment
npx tsx universal_doctrine_enforcer.ts && \
node orbt-validate.js && \
node udns-validate.js && \
echo "üéØ FINAL AUDIT PASSED - DEPLOYMENT ALLOWED"
```

## üö® ENFORCEMENT NOTES

**ORBT + UDNS Doctrine is SUPREME LAW. No exceptions.**

- All requirements must be completed before deployment
- No manual overrides allowed
- All violations must be resolved
- Compliance is non-negotiable

**This audit ensures that every application built from blueprints is fully compliant with the doctrine and ready for production deployment.**
